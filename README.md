The objective of this report is to address two optimization problems: a transshipment problem and a risk-minimizing problem.

Introduction

In this analysis, we have employed non-linear programming methods to enhance the resolution of complex problems that go beyond the scope of linear programming. The objective of this report is to address two optimization problems: a transshipment problem and a risk-minimizing problem. Both of the problems have practical applications in the business and investment sectors, providing valuable insights into the utilization of non-linear models.

The first problem pertains to the Rockhill Shipping & Transport Company project, where the company offers shipping services for waste transfer to disposal sites. Our goal is to minimize the overall shipping cost by optimizing the shipping route and the quantity of waste picked up and transferred between the client's plants and waste sites. We explore two different strategic plans, with one plan involving the implementation of intermediate shipping points.
The second optimization problem focuses on identifying the best portfolio allocation structure, allowing investors to achieve a certain expected return while minimizing the associated risk. Furthermore, we aim to uncover the relationship between the minimized risk and the expected portfolio return in the later part of this analysis.
